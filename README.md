A dataset by the Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Safety center was given which had health information about the use of Non-medical Prescription Drugs. The goal was identify patterns of drug use within the data and find any misuse between different demographic groups.

### Conclusion:
Based on the survey data, it was found out that people in Ontario with less than $60000 salary tend to misuse drugs more, while students with less than Bachelor's degree were the highest consumers of non-medical prescription drugs.
